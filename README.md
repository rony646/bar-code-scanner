<h4 align="center">Boilerplate React Native</h4>

The purpose of using the project is to minimize the redundant effort to setup a project from scratch. We spend a large amount of time to setup a project; changing file structure, installing libraries, create reusable components and so on. The boilerplate is a way to reduce the effort to setup a project.

## What is inside?

> You can open the project on multiple devices simultaneously. Go ahead and try it on an iPhone and Android phone at the same time if you have both handy.

- üçé On your iPhone or iPad, open the default Apple "Camera" app and scan the QR code you see in the terminal or in Expo Dev Tools.
- ü§ñ On your Android device, press "Scan QR Code" on the "Projects" tab of the Expo Go app and scan the QR code you see in the terminal or in Expo Dev Tools.

### Using a simulator or emulator?

If you are using a simulator or emulator, you may find the following Expo CLI keyboard shortcuts to be useful:

- Pressing `i` will open in an iOS simulator.
- Pressing `a` will open in an Android emulator or connected device.
- Pressing `w` will open in your browser. Expo supports all major browsers.

## Commands

- `expo start`: runs your application
- `android`: runs your application for android
- `ios`: runs your application for iOS
- `android`: runs your application for web
- `lint`: runs the linter in all components and pages
